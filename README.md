# DocDockDock theme for Hugo

This is the Hugo theme for my personal docs website, [docs.benjamin-altpeter.de](https://docs.benjamin-altpeter.de). It is based on:

* [Matcornic Learn theme](https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn/).
* [facette.io](https://facette.io/)'s documentation style css
* [docDock theme](https://docdock.netlify.app/)

As I have forked the docDock theme specifically for my site, there is currently no documentation on how to use it for other sites.
